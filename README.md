GBDK canine gait test.

# Building
Requires the latest GBDK.

Build `make gg-clean; make gg` for the Game Gear ROM. No other platforms are planned to be supported.

Replace `romusage.exe` with the version of [Romusage](https://github.com/bbbbbr/romusage) for your preferred OS, and then run `make gg-romused` to find out how each bank in the ROM is being used.
